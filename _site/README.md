This project is a website built for the HTML/CSS + JS capstone project at Microverse.

The project is based on an online website for a conference. The original design idea is by Cindy Shin - _<a href="https://www.behance.net/adagio07" target="_blank">view the website template on Behance</a>_.

I have personalised the template to build a website for a fictious Metal concert called Dethfest.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Jekyll - _<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation" target="_blank">view the Jekyll docs for the installation guide_

### Usage

The HTML used throughout the website is broken down into partials stored in the `_includes` folder.

The base HTML layout for pages on the website is stored in the `_layouts` folder.

_For more information, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure" target="_blank">view the Jekyll docs about the directory structure</a>_.

### Deployment

To build the website, run the following command in the root of the repo:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This creates a `_site` folder where the generated site will be placed.

To view the website, open the link of the server address displayed in the terminal

Alternatively, to view the website automatically after building, run the the following command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --open-url
```

#### Note

`_site` is currently not included in .gitignore to allow linters in GitHub Actions workflows to run on the Jekyll-generated website instead of the partials.
